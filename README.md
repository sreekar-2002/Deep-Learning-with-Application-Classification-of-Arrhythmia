Deep Learning-Based-Arrhythmia-Classification using 2-D ECG Spectral Images

This project involves using deep learning techniques to classify arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats) based on 2-D spectral images of ECG (electrocardiogram) data. In simpler terms, the project likely focuses on using advanced computer algorithms to automatically identify and categorize different types of irregular heart rhythms by analyzing visual representations of ECG data. This approach may offer a more automated and accurate way to diagnose and classify arrhythmias, potentially leading to improved patient care and medical diagnostics.
